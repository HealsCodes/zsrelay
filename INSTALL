The zsrelay Installation Tips.

o How to build and install

    Unpack the source.

	% gzip -dc zsrelay-X.Y.Z.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	% cd zsrelay-X.Y.Z

    Run configure.
      To see configuration options,
	% ./configure --help

      Configuration options.
	 --disable-thread               disable pthread feature.
	zsrelay configures to use pthread by default. if you prefer not
	to use pthread (to use forking server), disable it.

	 --with-libbind[=PATH]          to use libbind.
	If your system does not have IPv6 compatible name resolving API;
	getaddrinfo, getnameinfo,...etc.(e.g. Solaris 2.6), you have to
	prepare libbind library prior to configure zsrelay.
	Please See LIBBIND INSTALL.

	 --with-libwrap[=PATH|yes|no]   with tcp_wrapper access control.
	If your system has libwrap, you can use the same access control
	base.

	 --with-syslog-fac=FACILITY     syslog facility (LOG_DAEMON).
	Srelay logs through syslog. the default facility is LOG_DAEMON.

    Make
	If configure works without any errors, run make.

	% make

	( currently I have no 'install' target in Makefile. )

o LIBBIND INSTALL

    To install libbind, you have to get source code from outside this
    package. ISC BIND 9.2.2 may be handy for it.
    You may have installed BIND with its libraries, please check the
    installation pathes of it.

    If not, to get ISC BIND 9.2.2 source
	ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.2.2/bind-9.2.2.tar.gz

    And, build.
	% gzip -dc bind-9.2.2.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	% cd bind-9.2.2/lib/bind
	% ./configure
	% make
	% make DESTDIR=/path/to/temp install

    check the includes and libbind.a are there in
	/path/to/temp/usr/local/bind/inclue
	/path/to/temp/usr/local/lib

    Then, you may configure zsrelay.
	% cd /path/of/zsrelay-X.Y.Z
	% env LIBS="-L/path/to/temp/usr/local/lib" \
	  ./configure --with-libbind=/path/to/temp/usr/local/bind
	% make
